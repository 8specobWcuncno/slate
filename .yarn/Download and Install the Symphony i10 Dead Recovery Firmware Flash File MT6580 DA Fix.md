# How to Fix Symphony i10 Dead Boot Issue with MT6580 DA File
 
Symphony i10 is a popular Android smartphone that runs on a MediaTek MT6580 chipset. However, some users may encounter a dead boot issue after flashing the wrong firmware or performing a hard reset. This means that the phone does not power on or boot into recovery mode, and only shows a black screen or a red light.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to fix this problem using a special file called MT6580 DA (Download Agent) file. This file helps the flash tool to communicate with the phone and bypass the secure boot protection. By using this file, you can flash the correct firmware and revive your Symphony i10 from the dead boot state.
